**Backtesting Framework:**
```python
backtesting_components = {
    'historical_data': OHLCV data for target assets,
    'market_conditions': Bull/bear/sideways market simulation,
    'risk_scenarios': Volatility spikes, liquidity crises,
    'performance_metrics': Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate,
    'slippage_model': Realistic execution cost simulation,
    'fee_structure': Trading cost and funding rate modeling
}
```

**Test Case Categories:**

1. **Happy Path Tests:**
   - Normal signal processing and execution
   - Expected risk parameter enforcement
   - Proper balance tracking
   - Successful API interactions

2. **Edge Case Tests:**
   - Empty API responses
   - Invalid signal formats
   - Extreme market volatility
   - API rate limiting
   - Network connectivity issues

3. **Security Tests:**

   - Isolate individual components for focused testing
   - Create deterministic test scenarios
   - Validate error handling paths

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Test with various data quality scenarios
   - Validate technical indicator calculations
   - Test edge cases in market data
   - Ensure data integrity throughout pipeline

3. **Risk Validation:**
   - Test risk parameter enforcement
   - Validate position sizing logic
   - Test emergency mode compliance
   - Simulate margin call scenarios

**Test Automation:**
```python
automated_test_suites = {
    'unit_tests': 'pytest tests/unit/',
    'integration_tests': 'pytest tests/integration/',
    'backtesting_tests': 'pytest tests/backtesting/',
    'performance_tests': 'pytest tests/performance/',
    'regression_tests': 'pytest tests/regression/'
}
```
