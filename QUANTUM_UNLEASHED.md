# 🚀 QUANTUM SIGNAL UNLEASHING - ACTIVATED

## Configuration Changes (Path to $3M)

### 1. **Signal Generation Thresholds** ✅
- SNR_THRESHOLD: 0.6 → **0.35** (42% reduction)
- SIGNAL_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: 30% → **15% (50% reduction)
- MIN_SIGNAL_INTERVAL: 10s → **2s** (5x faster)

### 2. **Curvature Edge Optimization** ✅
- CURVATURE_EDGE_THRESHOLD: 0.8% → **0.3%** (62% reduction)
- CURVATURE_EDGE_MIN: 0.5% → **0.2%** (60% reduction)
- CURVATURE_EDGE_MAX: 1.5% → **1.0%** (33% reduction)

### 3. **Governor Acceleration** ✅
- GOVERNOR_BLOCK_RELAX: 120 → **30** blocks (4x faster recovery)
- GOVERNOR_TIME_RELAX_SEC: 1800s → **300s** (6x faster)
- TP_PRIMARY_PROB_MIN: 48% → **40%** (accepts more trades)
- TP_SECONDARY_PROB_MIN: 30% → **25%** (lower secondary)

### 4. **Position Sizing Amplification** ✅
- FORCE_MARGIN_FRACTION: 35% → **50%** (43% increase)
- SCOUT_ENTRY_SCALE: 55% → **70%** (27% increase)
- COMPOUNDING_LADDER: More aggressive margins at all levels

### 5. **Quantum Override Logic** ✅
- **Derivative Alignment Override**: When velocity, acceleration, and jerk align with >0.1% movement, bypass ALL statistical gates
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Skip rate limiting when price moves >0.2% in 5 samples
- **Calculus Trust**: Prioritize 4th-order polynomial derivatives over statistical confidence

## Expected Impact

With 50x leverage and these quantum optimizations:
- **0.2% price move = 10% profit**
- **0.3% price move = 15% profit**
- **0.5% price move = 25% profit**

The system will now:
1. Generate signals every 2-10 seconds instead of waiting minutes
2. Take trades with 40% win probability (leveraging 50x for asymmetric payoff)
3. Capture micro-movements as small as 0.2%
4. Execute rapid-fire consecutive trades when derivatives align
5. Compound aggressively with 50% margin utilization

## Real-Time Monitoring

Watch for these new log messages:
- `🚀 QUANTUM OVERRIDE for [SYMBOL]: derivatives aligned!`
- `🚀 QUANTUM: Skipping rate limit - strong movement`

## Risk Management

The system maintains safety through:
- Maximum 50x leverage (capped)
- Jerk-adjusted stop losses
- Dual take-profit targets (40% at TP1, trail rest to TP2)
- VaR guard at 25% portfolio loss
- Fee recovery tracking

## Launch Command

```bash
cd /Users/mukudzwec.mhashu/asym-trade-agent
./venv/bin/python live_calculus_trader.py
```

**STATUS: QUANTUM MODE ACTIVATED ✅**
**TARGET: $7 → $3,000,000**
**METHOD: 24/7 Calculus-driven micro-scalping with 50x leverage**
