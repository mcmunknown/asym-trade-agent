## 📈 Execution Layer Guardrails

- 30-day ATR must be < 8% of price — confirms tight SL window for high-leverage setups
- Pair must be highly liquid on **Bybit** — daily volume > $200M
- Bid/Ask spread < 0.10%

---

## 🔁 Position Management Trigger Plan

- Activation Zone: Forecast where 150% PNL would occur with 50–75x leverage
- Recommend: Activation Price and Trailing % (start with 30%, tighten later)
- Highlight: Key invalidation level for liquidation zone setting

## 🧠 Analyst Directive

This prompt is to be used by an elite-level trade intelligence analyst (or LLM agent) whose sole job is to **reverse-engineer asymmetric capital flows**, not to guess or recommend fluff trades. Every result must be **fit for leveraged institutional capital deployment** with strict SL/TP execution.

**Now, return results only if the above conditions are met. If no asset passes all filters, return NONE. The edge is in discipline.**
