## 🧠 Market Intelligence Filters (Must include all of the following)

### 🔹 Macro Tailwind (Narrative Context)
- Is there a macro or thematic driver? (e.g., ETF flows, L2 adoption, regulatory clarity, AI infra, tokenization narrative)
- Evidence of capital rotation or risk-on shift?
- What are central bank trends (Fed, RBA, PBOC) signaling toward crypto beta?

### 🔹 Institutional Flow + Protocol Fundamentals
- Treasury/founder wallet **accumulation** (last 60 days)
- Protocol revenue (fees/staking yield) trending **↑**
- TVL or staked token % increasing?
- Token burn, emissions reduction, or deflationary mechanics active?
- Developer commits or GitHub activity spike?

### 🔹 Structural Events Filter
- **NO** major unlocks, governance votes, forks, or token emissions scheduled in the next 7 days
- Confirm low dilution risk and no volatility traps

### 🔹 Derivatives Market Behavior (Bybit Only)
- Funding rate flat/negative despite price rising?
- Open interest ↑ at least 5% month-over-month?
- Liquidations clearing weak hands?

### 🔹 Technical Market Structure
- Price within **±15% of 30-day low** (ideal entry zone)
- Price above or reclaiming **20 EMA / 50 EMA** on **4H**, **1D**, and **1W** charts
- RSI between 50–70 (momentum building without exhaustion)
- Volume breakout confirmation — show 3D or 7D volume anomaly

---

## 📈 Execution Layer Guardrails

- 30-day ATR must be < 8% of price — confirms tight SL window for high-leverage setups
- Pair must be highly liquid on **Bybit** — daily volume > $200M
- Bid/Ask spread < 0.10%

---

## 🔁 Position Management Trigger Plan

- Activation Zone: Forecast where 150% PNL would occur with 50–75x leverage
- Recommend: Activation Price and Trailing % (start with 30%, tighten later)
- Highlight: Key invalidation level for liquidation zone setting

## 🛡️ Additional Filters (DO NOT OMIT)

- Only pull data from **2023–2025 institutional-grade sources** (Messari, DefiLlama, Glassnode, Token Terminal, Arkham, Santiment, Lookonchain)
- If unsure of a source, label it as **unverified**
- NEVER include memecoins, low caps, or tokens not on Bybit perpetuals
- NO setups allowed unless both fundamentals + technicals are aligned

## 🧠 Analyst Directive

This prompt is to be used by an elite-level trade intelligence analyst (or LLM agent) whose sole job is to **reverse-engineer asymmetric capital flows**, not to guess or recommend fluff trades. Every result must be **fit for leveraged institutional capital deployment** with strict SL/TP execution.

**Now, return results only if the above conditions are met. If no asset passes all filters, return NONE. The edge is in discipline.**
